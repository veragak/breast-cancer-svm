# Breast Cancer Classification with SVM (R + Shiny)

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for classifying breast tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using Support Vector Machines (SVM) in R, plus an interactive **Shiny app**.

## Structure

- `data/breast_cancer.csv` – Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset  
- `src/01_breast_cancer_svm.R` – Full analysis:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Train/test split and scaling
  - Linear SVM and radial SVM (default & tuned)
  - Logistic regression benchmark
  - Model comparison (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Balanced Accuracy, Kappa)
  - 2D decision boundary and variable importance
  - Saves tuned radial SVM model for the app
- `app/app.R` – Shiny app using the tuned SVM model
- `app/svm_shiny_model.rds` – Trained SVM model (generated by the script in `src/`)
- `slides/breast_cancer_svm_presentation.pdf` – Presentation slides

## How to run

1. Open the project in RStudio with the root folder `breast-cancer-svm`.
2. Run the analysis script:

```r
source("src/01_breast_cancer_svm.R")
```
3. Launch the Shiny app:

```r
shiny::runApp("app")
```
