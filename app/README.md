# Shiny App – Breast Cancer Classification (SVM)

This folder contains the **interactive Shiny web application** that uses the tuned Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a tumor is **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)** based on 6 key cell features.

---

## Files in this Folder

### `app.R`
- The main Shiny application.
- Loads the trained SVM model (`svm_shiny_model.rds`).
- Provides sliders for 6 tumor-related input features.
- Returns a prediction with color-coded output (red = malignant, green = benign).
- This app.R needs to be saved in the same folder as the data 

### `svm_shiny_model.rds`
- **Tuned radial SVM model**, trained on:
  - 6 interpretable features
  - 10-fold cross-validation
  - Repeated CV to maximize ROC AUC
- Includes:
  - Internal centering/scaling (`preProcess = c("center", "scale")`)
  - Best `C` and `sigma` parameters selected during tuning

⚠️ **This file is automatically generated** by running the main analysis script:

```r
source("R-Code/breast_cancer_svm.R")
```

## Model Explanation

The app uses a **Radial SVM (RBF Kernel)** because:

- The decision boundary between malignant and benign tumors is **non-linear**
- The tuned radial SVM achieved the highest:
  - **Sensitivity** (recall for malignant tumors)
  - **Balanced Accuracy**
  - **ROC AUC**
- It performs better than both **linear SVM** and **logistic regression** in this project

To make the app interpretable and fast, the final model uses **6 biologically meaningful predictors**:

1. `radius_mean`
2. `texture_mean`
3. `area_mean`
4. `smoothness_mean`
5. `compactness_mean`
6. `concavity_mean`

These were selected based on **SVM variable importance**.

## How to Run the App

### From the project root (recommended):

```r
shiny::runApp("app")
```
### Or inside the app/ folder:
```r
shiny::runApp(".")
```
The app will open automatically in your browser.

## How the App Works Internally

1. The user adjusts tumor feature values using sliders  
2. These values are passed into the **tuned radial SVM model**  
3. The model:
   - Applies the **internal scaling** stored in the `.rds` file  
   - Predicts `"M"` (malignant) or `"B"` (benign)`  
4. The output is displayed with a **color-coded prediction card**:
   - 🔴 **Malignant**  
   - 🟢 **Benign**

## Notes for Developers

- `svm_shiny_model.rds` **must exist** before running the app  
- If missing, generate it by running:

```r
source("src/01_breast_cancer_svm.R")
```
- You can update the model anytime by retraining and replacing the .rds file
- The app is lightweight and ready for deployment on:
    - shinyapps.io
    - Posit Connect
    - Docker containers
